### Individuals in Society: where does your responsibility begin and end?
The recent COVID-19 pandemic has raised questions over individual liberties versus the common good. Millions have been asked to restrict their trips and isolate at home, which some have regarded as a violation of their human rights and freedom, even though these measures have helped flatten the infection curve in many countries. Where does the personal responsibility of people lie, when the actions of an individual can have such consequences on the society?

### What ideas, if any, are worth dying for?
For thousands of years, people gave their life for their ideas and convictions, whether those were political, religious or humanitarian. Some philosophers such as Socrates, Hypatia, Giordano Bruno, Thomas More or Jan Patočka, have all been faced with the choice of either betraying their philosophy and staying alive, or dying to stay faithful to their convictions. They all chose the latter. Would you be willing to go as far to defend your ideas and convictions? And if so, for what ideas?

### What is the best form of government?
The year is 2060 and the Earth has been made inhabitable. A small group of people have made it to Mars to start it all over again. If you were to start from scratch, what kind of government would you form? Would it look like the governments we have today, or would it be different? How would you ensure that the errors of the past are not repeated?

### What makes you "you" despite the physical changes and new experiences that occurred in your life?
Are you the same person aged 10, 20, 50 or 80? Throughout your life you have gone through countless experiences and have met people who challenged and influenced your beliefs, to make them as they are today. What defines you as a person, independently of everything that happened to you, and everything that is happening around you?

### Humans need the Earth, but does the Earth need humans?
Since the industrialisation, humans have increasingly expanded their control over the natural elements, with the consequences that we are witnessing today (e.g. sparser rainfall leading to desertification, extreme weather compromising human agriculture, sea level rise increasing flooding, or storm intensification). While humans remain completely dependant on natural resources provided by the Earth, would she not be better off without us?

### How can we know what is real?
In 1999, a science fiction movie starring Keanu Reeves had everyone wondering whether the life we were experiencing was real or not. More than 20 years after The Matrix, many people are still considering the possibility that we are all living in a computer simulation. Whether it's a simulation made of bits, or a drug-induced hallucination, how can we know what is real from what is not?

### Are whistleblowers patriots or traitors?
The Cold War, 9/11 and more recently the NSA global surveillance programs that with the cooperation of telecommunication companies and European governments, have exposed the underlying tensions between confidential information in the name of national security and the fully informed citizens on which democracies depend. In that light, where do whistleblowers lie? Are they traitors who put their country in danger? Or patriots who want their fellow citizens to fully understand the actions of their government?

### How can the current crisis transform societies for the better?
The global pandemic we are currently facing has drastically changed the lives of billion of people around the world. From this sanitary crisis leading to huge drop in air pollution worldwide, to people taking more time to reconnect with their family and themselves, what lessons can we learn from it, that might shape our post-pandemic lives? What thinking and behaviour were re-discovered through this pandemic and should continue afterwards?
      
### Is life the sum of all our choices?
"We are our choices". This quote is from the famous French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre, but in the end, are we really the masters of our own fate or are we primarily subject to the forces around us, and hence, to the decisions of others? To what extend can we decide what our life is? Is it just easier to blame others than to accept the responsibility for the role of our own will?

### What's the difference between Hate Speech and Freedom of Speech?
Hate speech is defined by the Cambridge Dictionary as "public speech that expresses hate or encourages violence towards a person or group based on something such as race, religion, sex, or sexual orientation". Recently, there has been much debate over freedom of speech, hate speech and hate speech legislation. While many people will agree with the previous definition, others will disagree and defend their Freedom of Speech. So when does hate speech infringe upon free speech, or vice-versa?

### Can we be certain of anything?
Of course we can be certain of something! But wait, are we really sure about this? The Cambridge Dictionary defines certainty as "something that cannot be doubted". History is full of examples of how we, humans, have been misled by something that was not as it first appeared. It was not until the 16th century that a mathematical model of a heliocentric system was presented by Copernicus. Today, scientists are looking for evidences to support their hypotheses, so they can be considered true by their peers and the public, but does this mean they can achieve certainty? Can we all?
